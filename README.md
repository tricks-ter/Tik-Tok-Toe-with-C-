# Tic Tac Toe
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using C# programming language. The game can be played between a human player and a computer player. The human player always uses 'X' symbol while the computer player uses 'O' symbol. The game continues until either one of the players wins or the game ends in a tie.

## Getting Started
To play the game, simply clone this repository to your local machine and open the project in Visual Studio. Then, run the program to start playing Tic Tac Toe.

## How to Play
The game board is a 3x3 grid, and each player takes turns to place their symbol ('X' or 'O') on the board. To place a symbol, enter the row and column numbers when prompted. The first player to get three symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all spaces on the board are filled and neither player has won, the game ends in a tie.
